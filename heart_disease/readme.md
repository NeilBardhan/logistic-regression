# Heart Disease Diagnosis - A Classification Task

## Data

The data is a modified version of the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease), also known as the Cleveland Heart Dataset.

The data definitions are as follows.

The `num` field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient and is our **target** variable. It is derived from the `goal` variable, an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish **presence** (values 1,2,3,4) from **absence** (value 0). 

**Attribute Information:**

Only 14 attributes used: 
1. `age` : age in years 
2. `sex` : sex 
    * `1` : male
    * `0` : female 
3. `cp` : chest pain type 
    * `1` : typical angina 
    * `2` : atypical angina 
    * `3` : non-anginal pain 
    * `4` : asymptomatic
4. `trestbps` : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
5. `chol` : serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
6. `fbs` : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) 
    * `1` : true
    * `0` : false
7. `restecg` : resting electrocardiographic results 
    * `0` : normal 
    * `1` : having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 
    * `2` : showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria 
8. `thalach` : maximum heart rate achieved 
9. `exang` : exercise induced angina
    * `1` : yes
    * `0` : no
10. `oldpeak` : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
11. `slope` : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
    * `1` : upsloping 
    * `2` : flat 
    * `3` : downsloping
12. `ca` : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
13. `thal` : 
    * `3` : normal
    * `6` : fixed defect
    * `7` : reversable defect
14. `num` (**target**) : diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) 
    * `0` : < 50% diameter narrowing 
    * `1` : > 50% diameter narrowing
